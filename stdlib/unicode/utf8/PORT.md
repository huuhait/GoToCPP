# unicode/utf8

Ported by `tools/portstd` from go1.25.14's `src/unicode/utf8` (BSD-3-Clause, see `../../LICENSE`). Do not edit the `.gp` files by hand: the tool writes them again, and `make portstd-check` fails when a file differs from what it writes. A change goes into `tools/portstd/patches/unicode__utf8.rules` (a rule with a reason), or into the tool.
