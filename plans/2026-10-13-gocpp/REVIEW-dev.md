## Job dev.evalorder: `m[s+"x"] = append(m[s+"x"], f())` reads the key before `f` (Go: after)

### Brief

> (The exact coder brief from WORKFLOW.md §7.1, filled in; the same text went to all three coders.)

- **Goal:**
  Go evaluates `m[k] = append(m[k], args...)` by reading the map expression and the key **first**
  only into temporaries when `k` is not a name/constant, and it reads the key **after** the
  append arguments when the key needs no conversion for the fast map calls. gocpp reads it before
  in a case where gc does not: `sameSafe` accepts a string `+` in `*ast.BinaryExpr`, but gc's
  `ir.SameSafeExpr` has **no `OADDSTR`** — a string `+` is lowered to `OADDSTR` before the walk, so
  gc returns false and does **not** take the `mapAppend` fast path. gocpp's fast path then reads
  `s+"x"` before `f()`, and `f` changing `s` sends the value to the wrong key.

  The job: make `sameSafe` match gc's `SameSafeExpr` operator set (a string `+` is not reusable —
  it allocates and it is `OADDSTR` to gc, so drop `token.ADD` for string operands), and check the
  whole operator/conversion set against `ir/expr.go:1040` rather than only the reported case.
  Anything else that `SameSafeExpr` rejects must be rejected too, since every acceptance of it
  lets gocpp reorder relative to Go.

- **Reference / plan:**
  - `internal/lower/maps.go:495` (`mapAppend`, the fast path and its doc comment) and
    `internal/lower/maps.go:656` (`sameSafe`, the operator switch at 703–711 and the conversion
    case at 712–718).
  - gc: `$(go env GOROOT)/src/cmd/compile/internal/ir/expr.go:1040` `SameSafeExpr`; `walk/assign.go:39`
    (`ir.SameSafeExpr(left, mapAppend.Args[0])`, the only caller that matters here);
    `typecheck/typecheck.go:322–334` (where `+` of strings becomes `OADDSTR`).
  - `plans/2026-10-13-gocpp/phase-03-core-language/README.md` §2.3 (Maps).
  - Existing regression program `tests/diff/maps_append_key.gp` — it covers the key-type rule
    (`wrappedKey`) but **not** a key that is an expression whose operands `f` changes, which is
    exactly the bug. Read it; it is the model for the new test.

- **Done when:**
  1. A new differential test program (under `tests/diff/`, run by `TestDiff`) that fails on `dev`
     and passes with the patch: `m[s+"x"] = append(m[s+"x"], f())` where `f` changes `s`, checked
     against real Go with `scripts/gp-repro`. Add the neighbouring forms in the same program —
     `int + int`, `uint32 + uint32`, `float64 + float64`. (Only the string `+` is a bug today, but
     the test must pin the whole rule so a later edit cannot re-open it.) Keep the file
     gofmt-clean, `// phase: 03`, and end with the `// Output:` block, as the folder does.
  2. Whatever the correct answer turns out to be in each case, the program's `// Output:` block
     must equal `go run` on this machine (got with `scripts/gp-repro`, which diffs them for you).
  3. `scripts/gp-focused -x` green, and green again with `-cxx clang++` if you touched anything
     the runtime sees (you should not need to).
  4. Prove the new test fails before the patch: put the pre-fix commit hash and the failing
     output in the handoff.

- **Scope:** `internal/lower/maps.go` (+ its `_test.go` if a unit test is the natural place for a
  `sameSafe` case), and the one new `tests/diff/*.gp` file. Do **not** touch `wrappedKey`,
  `mapShift`, `mapPre`/`mapSimple` emission, or the general assignment-order machinery in
  `internal/lower/order.go` — the ordering they implement is already right; only the "is this
  expression safe to re-read" predicate is wrong.

- **TODO.md claims to fix (quoted):**
  > - [ ] Order: `m[s+"x"] = append(m[s+"x"], f())` reads the key before f (Go after): gocpp's
  >   `sameSafe` accepts a string `+`, gc's SameSafeExpr has no OADDSTR, so gc does not use
  >   mapAppend there (dev.makeslice review, also on dev).

- **Test commands the manager re-runs:** `scripts/gp-focused -x` in the version's worktree, plus
  `scripts/gp-repro` on the new program against real Go.

### Techlead research (performance-shaped jobs only)

Not a performance job. This is a Go-conformance (evaluation order) bug; no techlead stage.

### Rounds

| Round | Fresh reviewer # | Commit (state hash) | Manager test run | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| R1 | – | – | – | – |

Verdicts: `FINDINGS (n)` · `CLEAN` · `VOID (reason)`. Every reviewer number is a new instance.

### Findings

| # | Round | Severity | file:line | Failure scenario | Violated rule | Coder response | Adjudication | State |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| – | – | – | – | – | – | – | – | – |

- **Coder response:** `FIX` (the default: patch + failing-without test, named) · `REFUTE` (exception, **once per finding only**: evidence `file:line` + reproduction). The coder exists to shrink TODO.md, so refusing is rare.
- **Adjudication:** `CONFIRM-REFUTED` / `REJECT-REFUTED` / `FIX-VERIFIED (test fails pre-fix: yes)` / `FIX-REJECTED`, with the reviewer # and evidence. **Single pass: the reviewer's verdict is final in both directions; the manager closes a confirmed refutation without re-checking.**
- **State:** never set to `CLOSED-*` by the manager alone. `CLOSED-REFUTED` needs a coder refutation **and** a reviewer `CONFIRM-REFUTED`; `CLOSED-FIXED` needs a reviewer `FIX-VERIFIED`.

### Disputes

> None by design: `REFUTE` is single-shot and the reviewer adjudicates it once (WORKFLOW.md §6). This table exists only for a claim neither side could demonstrate, which goes to the user.
